    <h3>A. User Experience Requirements</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>1. Decompose proposed solution into user stories</h4>
    
    <span id="title">User Story 1: </span> 
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting host, I want to be able to activate Focus Mode so that the meeting 
      participants can engage in a flowing discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. While we believe that Focus Mode is a very helpful 
      feature, it does not need to be activated perpetually. There are situations where it would be more or less advantageous to use 
      the feature, and this use case allows the meeting host to toggle it at their discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> Whenever the host wants everyone to be part of the discussion, it should be in an orderly 
      manner because [1] Study reveals that speech and its components like … and turn taking skills are beneficial and effective 
      for comprehension of any interaction. Speaking skills and turn taking remain very important and useful as long as human 
      communication is involved.
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 2: </span> 
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting host, I want to be able to end a meeting participant’s turn when they are 
      finished talking so that if they forget to press on “finish speaking”, we can move along the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. While Focus Mode is meant to flow 
      in a way that guides a simulated flowing conversation, it requires the meeting participants to be paying attention to work as 
      fully intended. However, it is unrealistic to believe that meeting participants will always be giving the meeting their full 
      attention. Therefore, the meeting host’s ability to move to the next participant in the queue gives them more control over the 
      flow of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like many other virtual meeting platforms such as Skype and Microsoft Teams, 
      the host has the ability to mute or remove participants from the meeting. Therefore, the host should also be allowed to remove 
      participants from the Focus Queue.
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 3: </span> 
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I would like to see the people in the queue so that I know who 
      is speaking next and how long until I am able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. Meeting participants should be 
      able to know how soon they will be able to speak so that they can be prepared for their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any platform that has a queue function, the user will typically be able 
      to access the queue list.
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 4: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to join the speaking queue so that I can contribute to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. This is the main feature of 
      Focus Mode, and gives meeting participants a clear way to engage and join the conversation
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any platform that has a queue function, the user should be able to add to the queue.
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 5: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to be able to remove myself from the speaking queue so 
      that I do not have to speak if I do not want to. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. Users may accidentally join the 
      queue, or join the queue and realize that they no longer want to contribute to the conversation. There needs to be a clear 
      way for meeting participants to leave the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any interface that has a queue function, the user should be able to 
      delete from the queue.
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 6: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to be notified before I am up to speak so that I can be 
      ready to contribute to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. Users may be distracted and not 
      be paying attention when their turn is coming up. Having a notification pop up will remind them their turn is coming up and 
      that they should be prepared to speak soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> Like any interface that has pop up notifications, it is effective in grabbing the users 
      attention. [2] Update notification would be ideal - that is, a notification that grabs the user's attention through both 
      visual and auditory means, and that is overlayed on top of everything currently on-screen.
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 7: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to have a button to end my turn so that the next person 
      in the queue can speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. After the user is done 
      presenting, the user should have an action (such as clicking on end turn) to indicate that their turn is over instead of 
      waiting for the host to end it for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any platform that has a queue function, the user should be able to delete 
      from the queue.
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 8: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to be able to type in the chat box so that I can 
      contribute to the conversation even when it is not my turn to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is not relevant to our proposed solution. This feature is already 
      implemented in Zoom and most other popular video chat platforms. 
    </p>

    <span id="title">Justifications: </span>
    <strong>List of design features</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Meeting Host:
        <ul>
        <li>
          Start and End Focus Mode Button
          <ul>
          <li>
            Justification: We need a button in a familiar spot where the host can activate focus mode
          </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Button to remove a participant from queue (current or later speaker)
            <ul>
            <li>
              Justification: We gave the host the ability to remove participants from the queue or end the current speakers 
              turn in case someone is away from their computer or holding up the meeting
            </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Meeting Participant:
        <ul>
        <li>
          Mute/Unmute button is disabled
          <ul>
          <li>
            Justification: Mute button is disabled because the whole purpose of focus mode is interruption free discussion
          </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Both Host and Participant:
        <ul>
        <li>
          Queue List
          <ul>
          <li>
            Justification: We put the queue list as a pop-out to the right of the Zoom meeting so it would be easily seen, 
            not interrupt the main meeting interface, and in a familiar position since the chat and participants list both 
            pop-out to the right also
          </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Signifier at the top that you are in Focus Mode
            <ul>
            <li>
              Justification: We added the sentence “Focus Mode Enabled” at the top so that everyone in the meeting has a 
              signifier and knows they are in focus mode
            </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enter Queue/Leave Queue button
              <ul>
              <li>
                Justification: There needs to be a button to enter the queue so you can speak. We also added a leave queue 
                button so you can drop from the queue interruption free if you do not need to say anything anymore
              </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Confirmation when it is your turn to speak
                <ul>
                <li>
                  Justification: We decided it would be best to have a pop-up when you are next to speak so your attention 
                  will be focused if you are not looking and you will be prepared to speak without hesitation
                </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
