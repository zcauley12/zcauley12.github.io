    <h4>2. Relevant User Stories</h4>
    
    <span id="title">User Story 1: </span> 
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting host, I want to be able to activate Focus Mode so that the meeting 
      participants can engage in a flowing discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. While we believe that Focus Mode is a very helpful 
      feature, it does not need to be activated perpetually. There are situations where it would be more or less advantageous to use 
      the feature, and this use case allows the meeting host to toggle it at their discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> Whenever the host wants everyone to be part of the discussion, it should be in an orderly 
      manner because [1] Study reveals that speech and its components like … and turn taking skills are beneficial and effective 
      for comprehension of any interaction. Speaking skills and turn taking remain very important and useful as long as human 
      communication is involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> In our prototype, the button to enable Focus Mode is in the toolbar located on 
      the bottom of the screen in order for it to be alongside many of the other tools/modes that a meeting host can use (record, breakout rooms, etc.). 
    </p>

      <iframe width="1098" height="665" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1ojyy733-E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 2: </span> 
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting host, I want to be able to end a meeting participant’s turn when they are 
      finished talking so that if they forget to press on “finish speaking”, we can move along the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. While Focus Mode is meant to flow 
      in a way that guides a simulated flowing conversation, it requires the meeting participants to be paying attention to work as 
      fully intended. However, it is unrealistic to believe that meeting participants will always be giving the meeting their full 
      attention. Therefore, the meeting host’s ability to move to the next participant in the queue gives them more control over the 
      flow of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like many other virtual meeting platforms such as Skype and Microsoft Teams, 
      the host has the ability to mute or remove participants from the meeting. Therefore, the host should also be allowed to remove 
      participants from the Focus Queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> Next to each user’s name in the speaking queue, there is a red button labeled “Remove”
      in order to make it clear that the meeting host clicking the button will result in the respective user being removed from their place in the queue.
    </p>

        </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 3: </span> 
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I would like to see the people in the queue so that I know who 
      is speaking next and how long until I am able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. Meeting participants should be 
      able to know how soon they will be able to speak so that they can be prepared for their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any platform that has a queue function, the user will typically be able 
      to access the queue list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> In the sidebar of the Zoom window (where the chat or participant views would display), 
      there is a clear list of users who are in the queue to speak, with a clear indication of the current speaker through a green label that 
      reads “Speaking”. When the meeting participant is in the queue, the word “Me” is next to their name to make it clear to the user where 
      they are currently in the queue. 
    </p>

        </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 4: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to join the speaking queue so that I can contribute to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. This is the main feature of 
      Focus Mode, and gives meeting participants a clear way to engage and join the conversation
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any platform that has a queue function, the user should be able to add to the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> If the user is not currently in the queue, in the sidebar where the Focus Mode view is located, 
      under the queue, there is a large button labeled “Join Queue” that allows users to get a spot in the queue to speak. Its location and size makes
      it a clear signifier for the user.
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 5: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to be able to remove myself from the speaking queue so 
      that I do not have to speak if I do not want to. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. Users may accidentally join the 
      queue, or join the queue and realize that they no longer want to contribute to the conversation. There needs to be a clear 
      way for meeting participants to leave the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any interface that has a queue function, the user should be able to 
      delete from the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> If the user is currently in the queue, in the sidebar where the Focus Mode view is 
      located, under the queue, there is a large button labeled “Leave Queue” that allows users to remove themselves and forfeit their 
      spot in the queue to speak. Its location and size makes it a clear signifier for the user.
    </p>
    <div>
      <center>
      <iframe width="1099" height="665" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23IKGm7XrMA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>    
        </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 6: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to be notified before I am up to speak so that I can be 
      ready to contribute to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. Users may be distracted and not 
      be paying attention when their turn is coming up. Having a notification pop up will remind them their turn is coming up and 
      that they should be prepared to speak soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> Like any interface that has pop up notifications, it is effective in grabbing the users 
      attention. [2] Update notification would be ideal - that is, a notification that grabs the user's attention through both 
      visual and auditory means, and that is overlayed on top of everything currently on-screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> When it is the user’s turn to speak, there is a large popup overlay that gives a 
      5 second countdown until the user’s microphone is unmuted and they are able to speak. The large yellow caution sign is designed 
      to grab the user’s attention, and the countdown makes them aware of the timing. 
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 7: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to have a button to end my turn so that the next person 
      in the queue can speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. After the user is done 
      presenting, the user should have an action (such as clicking on end turn) to indicate that their turn is over instead of 
      waiting for the host to end it for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any platform that has a queue function, the user should be able to delete 
      from the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> If the user is the current speaker, in the sidebar where the Focus Mode view is 
      located, under the queue, there is a large button labeled “End Turn” that allows users to end their turn to speak and move the 
      next user in the queue to the speaking position. Its location and size makes it a clear signifier for the user.  
    </p>

        </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 8: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to be able to type in the chat box so that I can 
      contribute to the conversation even when it is not my turn to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is not relevant to our proposed solution. This feature is already 
      implemented in Zoom and most other popular video chat platforms. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> The Focus Mode Queue window and the chat window are arranged in a vertical 
      stack on the right of the overall Zoom window, allowing both functions to be viewed and used at the same time.

          <h3>B. Testing Protocol</h3>
          <br>
          
          <h4>1. Protocol</h4>
          <span id="title">Research Question: </span>
          <p>
            Does using Focus Mode reduce the amount of meeting interruptions/instances of people talking over each other and 
            make the discussion flow more efficiently?
          </p>

          <span id="title">Methodology: </span>
          <p>
            Mixed methods
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Observation: </span> We would watch a recording of randomly selected meetings to see how the participants are using Focus 
            Mode and whether it is working as intended. We would then compare these meetings to ones where participants are not 
            using focus mode to see its relative effectiveness.
            We are interested in using observations to gauge the natural conversation flow of Focus Mode as compared to a usual 
            video interface.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Survey: </span> We would have a survey at the end of the meeting that will gauge the users’ perceived reactions to the 
            effectiveness and intuitiveness of the system.
            Surveys are valuable because they can flesh out the user account in a way that’s not necessarily quantifiable by 
            external observation. This, we will employ surveys to determine if users actually perceive the Focus Mode as valuable 
            for smoothing transitions in video conversation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experiments: </span> We would have multiple groups engage in video meetings both utilizing Focus Mode and without Focus Mode 
            and compare the productivity from each group to visualize if there is a difference. The productivity will be measured 
            through the time it took to finish a meeting/activity in regards to how difficult/time consuming the task should take.
            This experiment allows us to control for external variables and isolate usage of Focus Mode as the variable affecting 
            the number of interruptions.
          </p>
        </li>
        </ol>
          <br>

          <h4>2. Testing Procedure</h4>
          <br>
          <span id="title">Testing Procedure: </span>
          <ul>
            <li>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Survey: </span> If Focus Mode was active for some duration in a meeting, there will be a 
            pop-up after a meeting has ended asking if the user is willing to complete a survey. The survey would utilize a 
            Likert scale or something similar to what is used in Microsoft teams. It would ask if the participants feel like 
            the meeting went smoothly, if everyone was able to contribute to the conversation, if they felt that their voice 
            was adequately heard, and if disruptions were lowered/eliminated. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Observation: </span> For randomly selected users/meetings, when Focus Mode is activated, 
              there would be a pop-up asking for permission to record the meeting for testing purposes. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experiment: </span> We will recruit random research participants for an experimental study in 
            which they participate as members of an English-speaking discussion group. IRB approval will be attained and 
            nominal compensation will be offered to participants for their time. The advertisement will be disseminated 
            widely to get a sample population representative of the larger US population. The experiment will involve a 
            researcher working as a moderator of a 10 research participant discussion group. There will be 10 such groups. 
            The moderator will ask 5 questions of each group, and we will record the Zoom meetings and count the number and 
            duration of interruptions (where users speak at the same time). In the control groups, normal Zoom will be used 
            for the discussion. In the experimental groups, Zoom with Focus Mode will be used for the discussion.
          </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
          <br>

          <span id="title">Informed Consent: </span>
          <ul>
            <li>
          <p>
            For the survey, there would be a pop-up asking if the user is willing to participate 
            in the survey. If so, they would be provided a link that takes them to a privacy policy so they have full 
            disclosure on how their data would be handled.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              For the observation, the pop-up would provide a link to a privacy policy that fully 
              outlines how their data would be handled. If the meeting host allows the meeting to be recorded, participants 
              will receive a popup alerting them that the meeting will be recorded for testing purposes. At this point, 
              they can view the privacy policy and stay in the meeting, or they may choose to leave. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For the experiment, we will apply for IRB approval and practice beneficence, 
            justice, and respect for beings. Recruited research participants will be fully protected under these principles, 
            and they will receive a nominal compensation for their time. They will be told that they are testing out a new 
            video software improvement by participating in a group discussion via our video meeting platform.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
          <p>
            We would collect the answers given in the post meeting survey and we would organize it by grouping together the 
            answers from each question. We would also take steps to anonymize any potentially identifiable data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              For the meeting recording, we would collect recordings of meetings and we would organize it by meeting size so 
              we could see how different numbers of people affect focus mode.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Based on the questions that were asked, the meetings are collected and organized based on the time of the 
            meeting. One section for Focus Mode on and one that is off.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
          <p>
            We would look through the survey answers and see if we received positive or negative feedback. We would look at 
            features of focus mode that received the negative feedback and consider making changes to focus mode. We would 
            also consider any specific suggestions given by survey participants.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              We would watch recordings of meetings and analyze the flow of the conversations and see if there were any 
              confusing UI elements that made it hard for users to use focus mode.
