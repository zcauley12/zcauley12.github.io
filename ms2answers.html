    <h3>A. Task / Problem Definition</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>1. Introduce Your Problem</h4>
    
    <span id="title">Problem: </span> 
    <p>
      When students and workers meet up remotely, it is common for people to start talking 
      over each other which causes problems such as confusion and a disruption of conversation flow.
    </p>
    <span id="title">Theme Relevance: </span> 
    <p>
      In classrooms or workplaces, people will usually use a gesture, such as 
      raising a hand, to signal that they have something to say without interrupting. However, 
      in a remote setting, the ability to signal that physical gesture is removed.
    </p>
    <span id="title">How do we know this is Typical: </span> 
    <ul>
      <li>
        Current video platforms have 2 different display modes where you can see other participants
        <ul>
          <li>
            Speaker Mode
          </li>
          <li>
            Gallery Mode
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        You either can't see multiple people, or you're inundated with visual information; in large groups with the latter, can be 
        difficult to find the speaker
        <ul>
          <li>
            Speaker signifier is highlighted box
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Directional gazes are hard to interpret with single camera
      </li>
      <li>
        Video-mediated gazes have less smooth amounts of floor control and amount of simultaneous speech
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>[3]</p>
      <span id="title">7 Stages of Action: </span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span id="list">Goal: </span> My goal is to speak in a discussion or meeting through a video calling software.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span id="list">Plan: </span> I gather my thoughts and begin to formulate what I want to contribute to the discussion/meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span id="list">Specify: </span> I decide what I am going to say, and take a deep breath before beginning my sentence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span id="list">Perform: </span> I begin speaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span id="list">Perceive: </span> I perceive that there were one or two other people who were also beginning to speak at the same time as me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span id="list">Interpret: </span> I either interpret the situation as awkward because multiple people attempted to speak at once, or I interpret my actions as rude because I may have interrupted someone else. Without the usual social cues from a face to face conversation, it is impossible to tell.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span id="list">Compare: </span> My goal of productively contributing to the discussion/meeting did not match the outcome of my actions and the situation. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h4>2. Identify Your Potential Users</h4>
      <span id="title">Potential Users:</span>
      <p>
        Traditionally, those affected by our problem of study would be those who have to regularly have remote meetings for work, school or other activities/organizations. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our group of potential users is much larger than before (e.g., Zoom reported surpassing 300 million daily meeting participants in April) and will include those who typically did not have meetings virtually before 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our potential users utilize video calls largely for meetings, collaborative work, and discussions. For all uses and users, the ability to have a natural flow of conversations is impeded by the online format. A solution will allow users to run meetings efficiently and effectively, cooperate to complete tasks, and have productive discussions without interruptions.

        B. Analysis of Existing Solutions
      </h3>
      <br>
      <h4>
        1. Describe Existing Solutions
      </h4>
      <span id="title">
        Existing Solutions:
      </span>
      <p>
        The current existing solution for this problem is the 'Hand Raise Feature' in video conferencing apps such as Zoom/Teams.
      </p>
      <span id="title">
        Pros:
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allows participant to show they have something to say without interrupting meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is easy for users to find the raise hand button.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can lower your hand if you do not need to speak anymore. Meeting host can lower others hands also.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span id="title">
        Cons:
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Could be hard to see if meeting host is not paying attention since it is a little hand icon next to the person’s name.
        </li>
        <li>
          Participants are displayed in the "participant list" in the order that they raised their hands. Participants that raised their hand first are displayed at the top. If the meeting organizer does not have prior knowledge of this before the meeting, there are no other signifiers to let them know the order in which hands were raised.
        </li>
        <li>
          This feature is geared more towards a classroom or panel interview setting where participants are asking questions instead of a collaborative meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have to manually mute and unmute yourself when called on by the meeting host, there is nothing stopping you from ignoring the hand raise feature and interrupting the meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meeting hosts are not able to raise their hands on Zoom currently.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        2. Describe Potential Guidelines and Solutions
      </h4>
      <span id="title">
        Principles of the Current Solution:
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Stive for Consistency:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The zoom hand raise button looks the same as all of the other buttons on the meeting interface.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hand raise notification shows up in the same spot as other “reactions” 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Offer Informative Feedback:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The “Raise Hand” button changes to “Lower Hand” when clicked on and vice versa.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a small hand in the top left corner of your box and to the right of you name in the participants list so you know your hand is raised.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Prevent Errors:
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you click the “Raise Hand” button, it changes to “Lower Hand.”  There is only one possible action so you can not raise hand again once it is already raised or vice versa.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Permit Easy Reversal of Actions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              When the “Raise Hand” button is selected, it allows you to lower your hand if you clicked it by mistake or do not need to speak anymore.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      C. Proposed Solution
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h4>
      1. Propose a Solution
    </h4>
    <span id="title">
      Our Solution:
    </span>
    <p>
      There is a button at the bottom of the Zoom/Teams/WebEx call named "Focus Mode" that the meeting host can activate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When activated, everyone is muted and it brings up a popup window that has the action buttons and shows the queue of everyone in line to speak. Everyone in the queue is numbered, 1 at the top, 2 underneath, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are muted and not in the queue, there is one button, "Speak" which puts you in the queue to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are in the queue, there is a button "Remove from Queue" that you can click if you do not need to speak anymore. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When it is your turn to speak, there is a sound,  a popup, or another indicator to let you know that it is your turn to speak in case you are distracted and not looking at the call. You are automatically un-muted and there is a button "Finish Speaking" that is available for you to press when your turn is over. You are then muted and the next person in the queue is unmuted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chat box is still available if you need to make a comment without interrupting the current speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meeting host has the ability to end someone's turn if they forget to hit the Finish Speaking button or if someone is away when it is their turn to speak so the meeting does not get stuck.

      2. How Will You Measure Success?
    </h4>
    <span id="title">
      Measuring Success:
    </span>
    <p>
      Although it is difficult to measure the success of this feature through numbers, we could measure the success by adding a quick popup rating of the feature from “did not help” to “very helpful” using the Likert Scale. This way, users can give feedback about their personal experience and feeling on the solution without taking up too much of their time.
