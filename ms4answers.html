    <h3>A. High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
    <br>
    
    <h4>1. Prototype</h4>

    <h4>2. Relevant User Stories</h4>
    
    <span id="title">User Story 1: </span> 
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting host, I want to be able to activate Focus Mode so that the meeting 
      participants can engage in a flowing discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. While we believe that Focus Mode is a very helpful 
      feature, it does not need to be activated perpetually. There are situations where it would be more or less advantageous to use 
      the feature, and this use case allows the meeting host to toggle it at their discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> Whenever the host wants everyone to be part of the discussion, it should be in an orderly 
      manner because [1] Study reveals that speech and its components like … and turn taking skills are beneficial and effective 
      for comprehension of any interaction. Speaking skills and turn taking remain very important and useful as long as human 
      communication is involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> In our prototype, the button to enable Focus Mode is in the toolbar located on 
      the bottom of the screen in order for it to be alongside many of the other tools/modes that a meeting host can use (record, breakout rooms, etc.). 
    </p>

      </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 2: </span> 
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting host, I want to be able to end a meeting participant’s turn when they are 
      finished talking so that if they forget to press on “finish speaking”, we can move along the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. While Focus Mode is meant to flow 
      in a way that guides a simulated flowing conversation, it requires the meeting participants to be paying attention to work as 
      fully intended. However, it is unrealistic to believe that meeting participants will always be giving the meeting their full 
      attention. Therefore, the meeting host’s ability to move to the next participant in the queue gives them more control over the 
      flow of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like many other virtual meeting platforms such as Skype and Microsoft Teams, 
      the host has the ability to mute or remove participants from the meeting. Therefore, the host should also be allowed to remove 
      participants from the Focus Queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> Next to each user’s name in the speaking queue, there is a red button labeled “Remove”
      in order to make it clear that the meeting host clicking the button will result in the respective user being removed from their place in the queue.
    </p>

        </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 3: </span> 
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I would like to see the people in the queue so that I know who 
      is speaking next and how long until I am able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. Meeting participants should be 
      able to know how soon they will be able to speak so that they can be prepared for their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any platform that has a queue function, the user will typically be able 
      to access the queue list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> In the sidebar of the Zoom window (where the chat or participant views would display), 
      there is a clear list of users who are in the queue to speak, with a clear indication of the current speaker through a green label that 
      reads “Speaking”. When the meeting participant is in the queue, the word “Me” is next to their name to make it clear to the user where 
      they are currently in the queue. 
    </p>

        </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 4: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to join the speaking queue so that I can contribute to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. This is the main feature of 
      Focus Mode, and gives meeting participants a clear way to engage and join the conversation
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any platform that has a queue function, the user should be able to add to the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> If the user is not currently in the queue, in the sidebar where the Focus Mode view is located, 
      under the queue, there is a large button labeled “Join Queue” that allows users to get a spot in the queue to speak. Its location and size makes
      it a clear signifier for the user.
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 5: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to be able to remove myself from the speaking queue so 
      that I do not have to speak if I do not want to. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. Users may accidentally join the 
      queue, or join the queue and realize that they no longer want to contribute to the conversation. There needs to be a clear 
      way for meeting participants to leave the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any interface that has a queue function, the user should be able to 
      delete from the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> If the user is currently in the queue, in the sidebar where the Focus Mode view is 
      located, under the queue, there is a large button labeled “Leave Queue” that allows users to remove themselves and forfeit their 
      spot in the queue to speak. Its location and size makes it a clear signifier for the user.
    </p>

        </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 6: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to be notified before I am up to speak so that I can be 
      ready to contribute to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. Users may be distracted and not 
      be paying attention when their turn is coming up. Having a notification pop up will remind them their turn is coming up and 
      that they should be prepared to speak soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> Like any interface that has pop up notifications, it is effective in grabbing the users 
      attention. [2] Update notification would be ideal - that is, a notification that grabs the user's attention through both 
      visual and auditory means, and that is overlayed on top of everything currently on-screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> When it is the user’s turn to speak, there is a large popup overlay that gives a 
      5 second countdown until the user’s microphone is unmuted and they are able to speak. The large yellow caution sign is designed 
      to grab the user’s attention, and the countdown makes them aware of the timing. 
    </p>
    <span id="title">User Story 7: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to have a button to end my turn so that the next person 
      in the queue can speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is relevant to our proposed solution. After the user is done 
      presenting, the user should have an action (such as clicking on end turn) to indicate that their turn is over instead of 
      waiting for the host to end it for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Evidence:</u></strong> (Status Quo) Like any platform that has a queue function, the user should be able to delete 
      from the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> If the user is the current speaker, in the sidebar where the Focus Mode view is 
      located, under the queue, there is a large button labeled “End Turn” that allows users to end their turn to speak and move the 
      next user in the queue to the speaking position. Its location and size makes it a clear signifier for the user.  
    </p>

        </center>
        </div>
    <span id="title">User Story 8: </span>
    <p>
      <strong><u>User Story:</u></strong> As a meeting participant, I want to be able to type in the chat box so that I can 
      contribute to the conversation even when it is not my turn to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Justification:</u></strong> This user story is not relevant to our proposed solution. This feature is already 
      implemented in Zoom and most other popular video chat platforms. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Extended Description:</u></strong> The Focus Mode Queue window and the chat window are arranged in a vertical 
      stack on the right of the overall Zoom window, allowing both functions to be viewed and used at the same time.
